Bean & Brew's new quinoa bowl is AMAZING! So fresh and filling - perfect for a healthy lunch. I've been coming here for years and they keep innovating their menu while keeping the classics. WiFi is fast and reliable, making this my favorite remote work spot. Chris at the counter is always cheerful and makes great recommendations. Love the sustainable packaging too!
