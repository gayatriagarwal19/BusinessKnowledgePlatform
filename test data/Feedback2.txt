Waited nearly 20 minutes for a simple cold brew and muffin during what didn't even seem like a busy time (Tuesday morning). The coffee was good when I finally got it, but the muffin was stale. I noticed other customers who came in after me got served first. Not sure if it was poor organization or favoritism, but I was late to my meeting because of the wait. Disappointing experience.
