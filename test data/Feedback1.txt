I absolutely love the atmosphere at Bean & Brew! The avocado toast is to die for, and the cappuccino was perfectly made with beautiful latte art. The staff was friendly and attentive, especially Miguel who remembered my name from my last visit. This place has become my go-to weekend spot. Highly recommend the window seats for people watching!
