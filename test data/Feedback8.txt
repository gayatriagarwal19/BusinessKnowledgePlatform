Disappointed with my evening visit. The "Evening Special" was not worth the $15.95 price tag. The soup was lukewarm and bland, the sandwich had barely any filling, and the dessert portion was tiny. Place was understaffed with only one server handling all tables, resulting in long waits. Coffee was good as always, but not enough to make up for the rest of the experience. They really need to improve their evening service if they want to be taken seriously as more than just a coffee shop.
