Average experience. The coffee is good quality but overpriced compared to other places in the area. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie which was underwhelming and seemed like it had been sitting out all day. The staff was friendly enough but seemed distracted. The place has potential but needs to work on consistency. The bathroom was clean though, which I appreciate.
