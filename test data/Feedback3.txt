Great selection of teas and pastries! I'm gluten-intolerant and they had several delicious options for me. The chai latte was perfectly spiced. Only taking off one star because the seating area was a bit cramped and noisy. Would definitely come back, but maybe during off-peak hours. The staff was very knowledgeable about ingredients when I asked about allergens.
