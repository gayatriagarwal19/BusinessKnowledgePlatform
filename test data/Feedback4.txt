Terrible experience. Ordered a grilled panini that was cold in the center. When I politely mentioned this to the server, they seemed annoyed and took forever to bring me a properly heated one. By then, my coffee was cold. The prices are way too high for this kind of service. $14 for a mediocre sandwich? Won't be returning. The place was also uncomfortably hot inside.
