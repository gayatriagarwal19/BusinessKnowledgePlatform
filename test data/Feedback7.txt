I hosted a small meeting here in their corner area and it was perfect! They accommodated our group of 6 wonderfully. Everyone loved the coffee and pastry selection. Sarah went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The new matcha latte is exceptional - not too sweet and perfectly creamy. Their mobile ordering system makes pickup so convenient when I'm in a rush.
